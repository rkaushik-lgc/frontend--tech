        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman">Sir Donald Bradman</a>, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered 
            Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that 
            "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had 
            asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him.
             Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[302][303]</p>
